Bitaxe Open-Source Mining Project: Scalable Multi-Chip Bitcoin Mining Solution

Overview

Bitaxe is a fully open-source Bitcoin ASIC mining project designed to provide efficient and scalable mining solutions. By utilizing BM1366 or BM1368 chips, Bitaxe enables high-performance, low-power SHA-256 mining while allowing users to customize and expand according to their needs.

The goal of this project is to leverage open-source designs to create large-scale mining systems, optimize power management, improve cooling solutions, and integrate centralized control systems to enhance hash rate and reduce operational costs.

1. Existing Bitaxe Miner Models

Features: Provides higher hash rate than UltraHex, ideal for miners seeking greater returns.

2. Scaling to Large-Scale Mining Solutions

To expand Bitaxe open-source miners for large-scale mining, the following optimization strategies can be implemented:

2.1 PCB Design Optimization

The current design supports 6 chips but can be expanded to 12-24 BM1368 chips.

More compact PCB designs to reduce unit hash rate manufacturing costs.

2.2 Power Management Optimization

Use server-grade power supplies (240V AC input, DC power bus) to improve efficiency.

Improve power modules to reduce losses and minimize heat generation.

2.3 Cooling & Thermal Optimization

Enhanced Air Cooling: Replace small fans with dual 120mm PWM fans for better cooling efficiency.

Liquid Cooling Option: Design water cooling blocks and integrate oil-based immersion cooling.

Immersion Cooling: Ideal for large mining farms, improves thermal management and reduces maintenance costs.

2.4 Control & Management System

Replace current Wi-Fi-based ESP32 control with centralized management.

Utilize Raspberry Pi or FPGA-based control units for unified miner management.

Support Ethernet connectivity to enhance communication stability.

2.5 Mining Software Optimization
